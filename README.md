# page_conv

page_conv is a program I created to automatically rewrite my web page (www.vietnam.net.pl) HTML-files to make the design more responsive for viewing on mobile devices.
I have created multiple sub-pages since 2007 and they all have a similar structure, but they all need to be updated (for example link new css file, verify UTF-8 encoding, get the "viewport" line). I also decided to make most of the images lightbox-viewable, so I'm rewriting my HTML files for that.
This program might also be used in future to incorporate other changes across multiple HTML-files.
